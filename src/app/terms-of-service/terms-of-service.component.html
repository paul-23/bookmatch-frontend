  <h1>Welcome to BookMatch!</h1>
  <p>
    The application that allows you to share books and literary experiences
    while having fun. Before diving into this world of letters and laughter,
    we invite you to read our Terms and Conditions. Remember that this
    version is completely fictitious and should not be used for any real
    projects. Enjoy!
  </p>
  <h3>Acceptance of Terms:</h3>
  <p>
    By using the BookMatch application, you agree to accept our terms and
    conditions. Although we know that nobody reads them, we encourage you to
    scroll through them at least once before clicking "Accept."
  </p>
  <h3>Use of the Application:</h3>
  <p>
    BookMatch is designed to be used solely for humorous and fictional purposes.
    We are not responsible if the books you share are actually copyrighted
    masterpieces or rare editions of valuable antique books. Remember, fiction
    is the key!
  </p>
  <h3>User Responsibility:</h3>
  <p>
    You are solely responsible for the books you share through the application.
    If you share boring books, poorly written books, or books that only serve as
    makeshift table levelers, we cannot be held responsible for the quality of
    your virtual library.
  </p>
  <h3>Copyright:</h3>
  <p>
    At BookMatch, we believe that copyright is a thing of the past. However, we
    do not tolerate piracy or plagiarism. If you come across books that infringe
    copyright on our platform, please ignore them and keep laughing.
  </p>
  <h3>Comments and Ratings:</h3>
  <p>
    We encourage our users to leave comments and ratings on the shared books.
    However, we reserve the right to remove any constructive, negative, or
    non-compliant comments that do not meet our standards of absurd humor.
    Remember, we're here to have fun, not to criticize.
  </p>
  <h3>Connection with Social Media:</h3>
  <p>
    BookMatch allows you to share your favorite books on your social media. We
    are not responsible if your friends unfollow you for flooding their feeds
    with fake books or ridiculous descriptions.
  </p>
  <h3>Privacy and Security:</h3>
  <p>
    At BookMatch, we take your privacy very seriously. We ensure that your
    personal data is as safe as a treasure buried on a deserted island. We will
    not share your information with third parties unless they make us laugh a
    lot.
  </p>
  <h3>Modifications and Updates:</h3>
  <p>
    We reserve the right to change these terms and conditions at any time and
    without prior notice. We will notify you of these changes by sending you a
    book with a hidden message on each page. If you can't find the message, it's
    your problem, not ours.
  </p>
  <h3>Legal Responsibility:</h3>
  <p>
    By accepting these terms and conditions, you agree not to sue us under any
    circumstances. In the event that you do, we are authorized to send you a
    book of ancient laws with confusing instructions on how to withdraw the
    lawsuit.
  </p>
  <p>
    Remember that these terms and conditions are completely fictitious and
    should not be used in a real project. BookMatch does not exist, and any
    resemblance to real applications is purely coincidental. Enjoy your imaginary
    literary experience and have fun sharing books that only exist in our parallel
    reality!
