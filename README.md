Here we can add books, the only things to remark here are the cover image, where if you dont give an image it tries to use the isbn to get an image from a free library api, if it can't find it it uses a default image. Also you must use an editorial from the existing editorials, if you wish to use another you have to use the add editorial button to add an editorial to the list.
